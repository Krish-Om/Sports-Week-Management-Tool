You are a senior full-stack engineer helping build a Sports Week Event Management Portal.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row Level Security)
- Both frontend and backend must be written in TypeScript

Project Goal:
Build a complete web application to manage inter-faculty Sports Week events including games, teams, players, matches, organizers, scoring, and overall faculty points.

Core Features:
- Faculty-based competition with overall points tally
- Both TEAM and INDIVIDUAL games
- Match scheduling, live status, results, and winner tracking
- Role-based access (Admin, Game Manager)
- Clean, scalable, production-ready architecture

Domain Model (ER Diagram Summary):

Entities and Relationships:
- FACULTY has many TEAMS and many PLAYERS
- ORGANIZER manages many GAMES
- GAME has many MATCHES
- MATCH has many MATCH_PARTICIPANTS
- MATCH_PARTICIPANT can be either a TEAM or a PLAYER (depending on game type)

Tables and Fields:

FACULTY
- id (PK)
- name (CSIT, BCA, BBS, etc.)
- total_points (calculated for overall trophy)

PLAYER
- id (PK)
- name
- faculty_id (FK → FACULTY)
- semester (e.g., 5th)
- phone

GAME
- id (PK)
- name (Futsal, Chess, etc.)
- type (TEAM or INDIVIDUAL)
- organizer_id (FK → ORGANIZER)
- rules_text

TEAM
- id (PK)
- name (CSIT 5th A, BBS 1st, etc.)
- faculty_id (FK → FACULTY)
- game_id (FK → GAME)

MATCH
- id (PK)
- game_id (FK → GAME)
- start_time (datetime)
- venue
- status (UPCOMING, LIVE, FINISHED)
- stage (League, Semi-Final, Final)
- winner_id (TeamID or PlayerID)

MATCH_PARTICIPANT
- id (PK)
- match_id (FK → MATCH)
- team_id (nullable, FK → TEAM)
- player_id (nullable, FK → PLAYER)
- score
- result (WIN, LOSS, DRAW)

ORGANIZER
- id (PK)
- name
- auth_id (Supabase User ID)
- role (ADMIN or GAME_MANAGER)

Constraints & Rules:
- TEAM games only use team_id in MATCH_PARTICIPANT
- INDIVIDUAL games only use player_id in MATCH_PARTICIPANT
- winner_id must match one of the participants
- Faculty total_points is derived from match results
- Organizers can only manage games assigned to them unless ADMIN

Frontend Requirements:
- Public pages: Games list, match schedule, live matches, results, leaderboard
- Admin dashboard: CRUD faculties, games, teams, matches, players
- Organizer dashboard: Manage matches, update scores, set winners
- Use Server Components where possible
- Use Supabase Auth for login
- Protect routes using middleware

Backend Requirements:
- Supabase SQL schema with proper relations
- RLS policies for ADMIN and GAME_MANAGER
- Secure inserts/updates for match results
- Computed faculty points via SQL or edge functions

Development Expectations:
- Generate folder structure
- Generate database schema SQL
- Generate Supabase policies
- Generate Next.js pages, components, and server actions
- Follow clean architecture and best practices
- Explain assumptions before coding when necessary

Start by:
1. Designing the Supabase database schema and RLS policies
2. Proposing frontend folder structure
3. Building core pages incrementally
